## FastAPI and Streamlit
The code snippets provided in this section have been deployed on the Hugging Face platform. 
They are included here solely for ease of examine. Initially, I developed an API using FastAPI to facilitate access to the model. Subsequently, I tailored my SentimentAndIntentionAnalysis.py module to align with this API. The API was then deployed on the Hugging Face platform. You can explore and test the API functionality at https://kubrabuzlu-sentimentandintentionanalysis.hf.space/docs. Following this, I utilized Hugging Face to create a Streamlit-based user interface, establishing integration with the previously deployed API. Access to the Text Analysis App I crafted is available at https://huggingface.co/spaces/kubrabuzlu/SentimentIntentetionAnalysis.
